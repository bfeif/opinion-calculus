# What Information Geometry has to teach us about Empathy

Do you know the sensation of having your opinion change? At the beginning, you believe that ketchup is the best hot-dog topping; then, you slowly wake up to the truth that mustard is the best. Or, you believe that West Coast rap is better than East Coast, but then you wake up to the truth that Biggie is the GOAT.

In any case of changing your opinion from one stance to another, there's a point halfway along the way where you feel considerably increased doubt. For example, in your condiment-opinion transition, you might find yourself wondering "Is ketchup better than mustard? What about both? How about no condiments? What's a condiment?". If you have found yourself toiling with these deep questions, awaking from nightmares of a ketchup vs mustard boxing match, then don't worry. You're not alone.

Information geometry can help make sense of all this.

# What's Information Geometry?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_geometry):
> [Information geometry] studies statistical manifolds, which are Riemannian manifolds whose points correspond to probability distributions.
Whoa, jargon alert much?
